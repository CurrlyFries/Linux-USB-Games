# Linux-USB-Games
A tool that sets up a usb stick to run drm-free games within itself (ie. doesn't use a pc's home folder and uses the root of your usb instead)

Title is a placeholder

Currently I am setting up UMU to run games with proton-ge

I will be moving on to native games later

# The Idea

THE SCENARIO:
You are someone with a lot of drm free games. One day, you find yourself wanting to play those games on a computer that isn't yours, say a work computer or a friend's computer, so you put them on a usb stick.

THE PROBLEM:
You may not have the freedom to create save files, or install dependancies on this other computer, or you might just want to keep the saves for use on you main pc, and aren't able to set up dropbox for cloud saves.

THE SOLUTION:
This project will (hopefully) be able to make files on a usb stick that will allow you to run a game without invading a computer to install things and save, and keep save files and dependancies installed and ready to use on any linux (and maybe one day windows) pc, without needing to install anything past the first installation.
